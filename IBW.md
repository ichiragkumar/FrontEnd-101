Volunteer Experience:
I am Chirag Kumar, currently working on building GetWalletX. Over the last three years, I have been deeply involved in the crypto and blockchain space, volunteering at numerous events, hackathons, and conferences. One of my notable experiences was volunteering for Google Cloud Community Day in Bangalore, where I managed the event’s social media presence. Additionally, I played a key role in organizing the Hack2Skill 2 Days Hackathon, “Build for Bharat,” where I coordinated various logistical tasks, helping participants have a smooth and productive experience. These roles have enhanced my skills in event management, collaboration, and handling the fast-paced nature of large-scale blockchain events.
Each event I’ve been involved with has taught me valuable lessons in teamwork, quick decision-making, and handling real-time challenges, all of which will help me contribute effectively to IBW 2024.

Why I am a Great Fit for the IBW 2024 Volunteer Program:
I believe I would be an excellent fit for the IBW 2024 Volunteer Program because of my extensive experience in the blockchain community and my passion for fostering innovation through events. I have developed strong soft skills, governance practices, and leadership abilities, which are crucial for ensuring the smooth execution of an event like IBW. My past experience managing teams, handling logistics, and ensuring proper communication flow will allow me to contribute to IBW efficiently and effectively.
Furthermore, I am always eager to learn and grow. I see this opportunity as a way to connect with like-minded professionals and expand my network within the blockchain space, while also contributing to the success of the conference.

How I Would Improve the Event:
If given the opportunity to contribute further to IBW 2024, I would focus on enhancing the attendee experience by incorporating a more structured networking component, where participants could connect with key industry figures in a streamlined manner, perhaps through pre-scheduled one-on-one sessions. I would also integrate more interactive workshops that focus on real-world applications of blockchain technologies, giving participants not only theoretical knowledge but also hands-on experiences that they can take back and apply in their work.
Additionally, leveraging social media and real-time updates during the event would be a great way to engage attendees and create buzz around IBW 2024, something I’ve successfully managed in the past.
If I had the opportunity to run the event, I would also introduce a mentorship program, pairing volunteers and participants with experienced blockchain professionals, to create long-term relationships and learning opportunities.
